# Pawsitive Pathways - Dog Therapy Website Prototype

## Project Description

This is a website prototype for "Pawsitive Pathways," a project focused on providing dog therapy for individuals suffering from body dysmorphia. The website aims to be cute, uplifting, and modern, with a strong theme of puppies and paws.

This prototype is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is intended to showcase the design, theme, and basic structure of the website. **Functionalities like booking and the forum are simulated or hardcoded and are not fully functional in this prototype.**

The main focus of this prototype is on the **design and user experience**, demonstrating a cute and modern aesthetic suitable for the target audience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the website content and layout (`index.html`).
- **CSS:** For styling the website, creating the cute and modern theme, and handling responsive design (`style.css`).
- **JavaScript:** For basic interactive elements like the image carousel, "Read More" expandable sections, simulated form submissions, and the simulated forum interactivity (`script.js`).
- **Font Awesome:** For scalable vector icons, enhancing the visual elements of the website.
- **Google Fonts:** Using "Nunito" and "Poppins" fonts for headings and body text to contribute to the desired aesthetic.

## How to Run the Prototype

1.  **Ensure you have a web browser installed** (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory** on your computer where you have saved `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and the `images` folder.
3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.** You can do this by:
    - Double-clicking the `index.html` file in your file explorer.
    - Right-clicking on `index.html` and selecting "Open with..." and choosing your web browser.
    - Dragging and dropping the `index.html` file into an open browser window.

The website prototype should then open in your browser, allowing you to navigate through the different sections and interact with the simulated functionalities.

## Functionality Notes (Prototype Limitations)

- **Booking Form:** The booking form is simulated. Submitting the form will display a success message, but no actual data is sent or stored.
- **Contact Form:** Similarly, the contact form is simulated and will only display a success message upon submission.
- **Anonymous Forum:** The forum section is also simulated. You can type and submit new posts, and they will appear on the page dynamically (using JavaScript), but these posts are not saved and will be lost if you refresh the page. The forum is not a real, persistent forum.
- **Image Carousel:** The image carousel on the homepage is functional for demonstration purposes, allowing you to navigate through the provided images.
- **"Read More" Sections:** The "Read More..." buttons in the "About Us" and "Our Therapy" sections are functional, expanding and collapsing the text content as intended.

## Customization and Further Development

This prototype is designed to be easily customizable. You can:

- **Modify `index.html`:** To change the website content, structure, or add/remove sections.
- **Modify `style.css`:** To adjust the visual theme, colors, fonts, layout, and overall styling.
- **Modify `script.js`:** To alter or extend the basic JavaScript functionalities, or to add more simulated interactions.
- **Replace Images:** **Crucially, replace the placeholder images in the `images` folder** with your own images to personalize the website and fully realize the visual theme. Ensure you use images that fit the "cute and uplifting" theme.
- **Expand Functionality:** For a full website, you would need to develop backend functionality, a database, and server-side code to implement real booking, forum, and contact form features.

## Image Placeholders

Remember to replace the placeholder images in the `images` folder to make the website your own. Key images to consider replacing include:

- `paw-logo.png` (Website logo)
- `puppy-hero.jpg`, `puppy-slide-2.jpg`, `puppy-slide-3.jpg` (Homepage carousel images)
- `dog-and-person.jpg` (About Us section)
- `therapy-dog-session.jpg` (Therapy Sessions section)
- `therapist-1.jpg`, `therapist-2.jpg`, `therapist-3.jpg` (Meet Our Team section - replace with actual team photos or representative placeholders)
- `dog-buddy.jpg`, `dog-luna.jpg`, `dog-charlie.jpg` (Meet Our Therapy Dogs section - replace with photos of your therapy dogs or representative dog images)
