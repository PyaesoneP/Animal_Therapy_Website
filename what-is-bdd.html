        <h1>Understanding Body Dysmorphia</h1>
        <p>
          Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a mental health condition where you
          can't stop thinking about one or more perceived defects or flaws in
          your appearance — a flaw that appears minor or can't be seen by
          others. But to you, these flaws are significant and cause you distress
          and impact your daily life.
        </p>

        <h2>Symptoms of BDD</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Being extremely preoccupied with a perceived flaw in appearance that
            to others can't be seen or appears minor
          </li>
          <li>
            Strongly believing that you have a defect in your appearance that
            makes you ugly or deformed
          </li>
          <li>
            Engaging in behaviors aimed at fixing or hiding the perceived flaw
            that are hard to resist and difficult to control, such as frequently
            checking the mirror, grooming, or skin picking
          </li>
          <li>
            Trying to hide perceived flaws with styling, makeup or clothes
          </li>
          <li>Constantly comparing your appearance with others</li>
          <li>
            Frequently seeking reassurance about your appearance from others
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>It's More Than Just Vanity</h2>
        <p>
          It's important to understand that BDD is not simply about being vain
          or overly concerned with appearance. It's a serious condition that can
          significantly impact mental well-being and quality of life.
        </p>

        <h2>Seeking Professional Help</h2>
        <p>
